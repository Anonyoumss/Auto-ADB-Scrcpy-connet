<summary>Expand for Windows instructions</summary>

### Step 1: Save the Scripts

Copy the content of the PowerShell scripts:

- `adb_auto_connect.ps1`
- `adb_scrcpy_auto_launch.ps1`

Save them in a convenient folder (e.g., `C:\Scripts`).

### Step 2: Run PowerShell as Administrator (if needed)

Open PowerShell and navigate to your scripts folder:

```powershell
cd C:\Scripts
```

### Step 3: Make Execution Policy Allow Scripts (if needed)

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Step 4: Run the Desired Script

For auto-connect:

```powershell
.\adb_auto_connect.ps1
```

### Step 5: First-Run Prompts

- On first run (or if `adb_config.txt` is missing), you will be prompted to use default paths for ADB and Scrcpy.
- If you choose **Y (Yes)**, it will attempt to use default locations.
- If you choose **N (No)**, you can specify custom locations.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Common Troubleshooting

- **ADB Not Found:** Ensure ADB is installed and in your system PATH, or specify the path when prompted.
- **Scrcpy Not Found:** Ensure Scrcpy is installed and in your system PATH, or specify the path when prompted.
- **Permission Errors (Linux/Mac):** Make scripts executable (`chmod +x ...`) and check ADB user group membership.
- **Device Not Connecting:** Confirm the device is on the same network and ADB debugging is enabled.
